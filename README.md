**Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning Classifiers**


Phishing is a significant cybersecurity threat where attackers deceive users into providing sensitive information by pretending to be trustworthy entities. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to differentiate between phishing and legitimate URLs.

**Model Training**
Various classifiers used for training include:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
XGBoost
Catboost
AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree
LightGBM

Ensemble methods combining multiple classifiers are employed to improve performance.

**Results**
The results show the combined classifier (Random Forest + XGBoost) achieves the highest performance. Detailed metrics and visualizations are provided for comparison.
